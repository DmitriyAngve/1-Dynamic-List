# 1-Dynamic-List

This is first small project with using API (in this case data store in dummy json file). Represents a dynamic list fully interactive, the content coming from json file that also stores to local storage, and give ability to make some updates. Toggle the active and not active.
With option to remove items from list and still be able to refresh the page (reload the initial JSON data). So make a request to the JSON data and load that onto the page. And add item to the list.

So, nothing special, only practice with DOM manipulation / using localStorage / working with JSON data.

Unpretentious style included!
